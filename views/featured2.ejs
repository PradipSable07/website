This can be done by filing your <strong>80G</strong> claims for donations made during the Financial Year (FY). You can download your <strong>10BE</strong> from the ‘My Profile’ section by <strong>31st May</strong> of the next FY and also receive it via email.</p>

                            <p>For example: if you made donations between <strong>April 2023</strong> and <strong>March 2024</strong> (FY 2023-24), you will get your <strong>10BE</strong> by <strong>31st May 2024</strong>, provided you need to claim the <strong>80G</strong> for these donations.</p>

                            <p>Please note that you cannot claim <strong>80G</strong> for donations made between <strong>April 2022</strong> and <strong>March 2023</strong> (FY 2022-23) anymore as the window for claiming it has closed. However, you can still get the <strong>10BEs</strong> for that year if you made <strong>80G</strong> claims on or before <strong>31st July 2023</strong>.</p>
