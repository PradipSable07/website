                        <strong>HIV/AIDS is a devastating disease that affects millions of people around the world, including children.</strong> Children who are born with HIV or who contract it from their parents face many challenges, including discrimination, stigmatization, and limited access to healthcare. Without proper treatment, HIV can be a life-threatening disease. We believe that every child deserves the chance to live a healthy and fulfilling life, regardless of their HIV status.

                        <strong>The first step in saving the lives of HIV-affected children is to raise awareness about the challenges they face.</strong> Many people are not aware of the impact that HIV has on children, and this lack of understanding can lead to stigmatization and discrimination. By raising awareness, we can reduce the stigma associated with HIV and encourage people to support HIV-affected children.

                        <strong>Reducing stigma and discrimination is also critical in saving the lives of HIV-affected children.</strong> Many children living with HIV face discrimination and exclusion from their communities and schools. This can have a devastating impact on their self-esteem and mental health. By promoting understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for HIV-affected children.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>In conclusion, saving the lives of HIV-affected children is a collective responsibility.</strong> We must raise awareness, provide access to life-saving medications and treatments, support families and communities affected by HIV/AIDS, and reduce stigma and discrimination. By working together, we can ensure that every child has the chance to live a healthy and fulfilling life, regardless of their HIV status. Let us take action today to save the lives of HIV-affected children and create a more just and compassionate world for all.

                            <p>After you complete your donation successfully, you will find the <strong>'GET 80G'</strong> button on the payment success page. Please fill in your PAN number, complete address, and name as per PAN and submit. Your <strong>80G certificate</strong> will be generated and sent via email within 24 hours.</p>

                            <p>Alternatively, you can get your <strong>80G receipt</strong> in a few simple steps:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Log in to your account using the same email ID you used for the donation</li>

                              <li>Choose the financial year for which you'd like the donation certificate</li>
                              <li>Click on <strong>‘Download 80G Certificate’</strong></li>
                              <li>Fill out the Form (if required)</li>

                            <p>Instead of receiving separate <strong>80G certificates</strong> for each donation, you'll receive a consolidated <strong>80G certificate</strong> via email covering all your donations made through our platform in the financial year. Further, The corresponding <strong>10BE form</strong> that proves your eligibility for the tax deduction will also be consolidated. This way, you won't have to worry about multiple downloads and can save time.</p>

                            <p>To qualify for tax exemption on your donations, you need to obtain a <strong>10BE</strong>. This can be done by filing your <strong>80G</strong> claims for donations made during the Financial Year (FY). You can download your <strong>10BE</strong> from the ‘My Profile’ section by <strong>31st May</strong> of the next FY and also receive it via email.</p>

                            <p>For example: if you made donations between <strong>April 2023</strong> and <strong>March 2024</strong> (FY 2023-24), you will get your <strong>10BE</strong> by <strong>31st May 2024</strong>, provided you need to claim the <strong>80G</strong> for these donations.</p>

                            <p>Please note that you cannot claim <strong>80G</strong> for donations made between <strong>April 2022</strong> and <strong>March 2023</strong> (FY 2022-23) anymore as the window for claiming it has closed.

                            At RHLF, we value 100% trust and transparency. It is mandatory for NGOs to send updates to donors,once the campaign is completed. We request you to wait for a few days so that we can deliver the products to our NGO partners and they can distribute them to the needy.Within a month,you would see update(s) in the form of pictures or videos from the NGO in the 'Updates Tab' of the campaign you donated to.
